This is theme is a sub-theme of the microsite base theme.  It should be renamed to reflect the site it belongs to.

Ex: 
-   Site = Cancermedicine
-   Theme Directory = cancermedicine_theme
-   Info File = cancermedicine_theme.info
-   "Name" in cancermedicine_theme.info = cancermedicine_theme

Please just use this sub-theme for CSS overrides pertaining to only to the typography and other superficial styles.
